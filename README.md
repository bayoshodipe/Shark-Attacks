The relaxation and serene environment at beaches and Oceans attracts many people every day, especially at weekends. If proper care is not taken, one can easily fall prey to the attack of sharks. this is not the only way people get attacked as this report shows that fishing at sea is the second highest activity with high shark attacks reported during the review period (1900 to 2017) after surfing which recorded about 937 attacks. Other recreational activities that follow are swimming and diving. Twenty-one (21) Multiple attacks were recorded and it was paramount in the peak year of 1959 and 2006 recording about 4 and 2 multiple attacks respectively.

## Data Used

**Data** - Shark Attacks Data with 22 columns and 25,614 rows from the year 1900 to 2017 provided by #Quantun Analytics NG.

**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - Excel and PowerBI

## Questions
1. What is the trend in the number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900?
2. Which countries lead in reporting the highest number of shark attacks? And within those countries, what specific areas and locations appear to pose the greatest danger in terms of shark encounters?
3. Which body parts are frequently injured in shark attacks, and how can text analysis of the "Injury" column assist in identifying these patterns?
4. How does the frequency of shark attacks vary throughout different parts of the day? Considering that the "Time" data requires transformation before analysis, what steps would you take to prepare it for examination in determining patterns of attack occurrence?
5. What species of sharks are responsible for the highest number of attacks? Given the messy state of the data, what strategies would you employ to clean and analyze it effectively to identify the most frequent attackers?

## Summary of Findings
1. Areas around the oceans have shown the highest shark attacks with Vanuatu a small island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean and Venezuela a country located at the northern end of South America bordered by the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. In this report about 4,264 attacks were reported involving about 4290 victims which consists of about 3421 males and 366 females
2. 72% of the attacks are non-fatal, as body parts mostly attacked are the hands and legs. this correlates with the activities with the highest number of attacks recorded.
3. 221 attacks were recorded in the afternoon around 2 p.m. and the high rate coincided with the day of the week with the highest attacks being weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). these are the days families, and citizens come out to enjoy the serene environment of the ocean. Other times are 8.00 am, 10.00 am, 11.00 am and 8.00 pm, these are times when the majority of this activity recorded takes place.
4. 483 of the attacks recorded are linked to white shark species also known as the great white shark, they are notable for their size, and jaw power. 218 and 90 attacks are attributed to the tiger and bull sharks, respectively.

## Recommendations
From this report, I will advise the regulation authorities in charge of the beaches and oceans to put in place safety precautions around dangerous areas so that fun seekers will not have access to those areas and for those handling fish such as sharks to use appropriate protective gadgets. The day times outlined as having high attacks should have more safety personnel to help those injured as most of these attacks are non-fatal. First aid kits should be mandatory for all boats and canoes going to the ocean for fishing.
